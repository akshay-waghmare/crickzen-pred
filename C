# Agent Guide for machine_learning_bbl

This file orients coding agents to build/test workflows and local code style.
It combines repository docs plus Copilot/agent rules. Follow this doc before
editing code or running commands.

## Sources Of Truth

- `README.md` for CLI workflows and examples.
- `pyproject.toml` for Python version and packaging.
- `docs/` for model, calibration, and simulation details.
- Copilot guidance in:
  - `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
  - `.github/agents/copilot-instructions.md`

## Environment And Layout

- Language: Python >= 3.10 (root `pyproject.toml`).
- Main package: `src/bbl_pipeline/`.
- Tests: `tests/`, `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`.
- Models are under `models/` with archived ones in `models/archive/`.
- Data folders (mostly gitignored): `data/`, league JSON folders in repo root.
- CLI entrypoint: `bbl-pipeline` (from `bbl_pipeline.cli`).

## Build, Lint, Test

### Install

- Editable install: `pip install -e .`
- Live prediction extras (from README):
  - `pip install playwright pandas numpy scikit-learn structlog joblib`
  - `playwright install chromium`

### Tests (Pytest)

- Full suite: `pytest`
- Single file: `pytest tests/test_simulation.py -v`
- Single test: `pytest tests/test_simulation.py -k test_name -v`
- Unit suite: `pytest tests/unit/ -v`
- Integration suite: `pytest tests/integration/ -v`
- Monte Carlo tests (docs):
  - `pytest tests/test_simulation.py -v`
  - `pytest tests/integration/test_simulation_integration.py -v`

### Lint / Format

- From `.github/agents/copilot-instructions.md`:
  - `cd src; pytest; ruff check .`
- The repo does not define Ruff config in root; keep changes aligned with
  existing style if Ruff is not installed.
- Scraper subproject formatting is configured in `scraper/pyproject.toml`:
  - Black line length: 100
  - Isort profile: black
  - Flake8 max line length: 100, ignore E203/W503

### Build / Pipeline Commands

- Full retrain (recommended): `bbl-pipeline retrain --league <league> --version <v>`
- Update matches: `bbl-pipeline update-matches --league <league> [--dry-run]`
- Ingest: `bbl-pipeline ingest --input-dir data/raw_json/<league> --output-dir data/<league>_raw`
- Process: `bbl-pipeline process --input-dir data/<league>_raw/matches --output-dir data/<league>_features_v2 --feature-store-dir data/<league>_feature_store_v2`
- Train: `bbl-pipeline train --input-file data/<league>_features_v2/training.parquet --output-dir models/<league>_vX`
- Generate OOF calibrators: `bbl-pipeline generate-oof --input-file ... --model-dir ...`
- Analyze OOF: `bbl-pipeline analyze-oof --input-file ... --model-dir ... --n-splits 5`

## Code Style And Conventions

### Imports

- Use absolute imports from `bbl_pipeline` (Copilot rule).
- Group imports: standard library, third-party, local.
- Avoid relative imports across packages; keep modules importable from `src/`.

### Formatting

- Default indentation is 4 spaces.
- Keep line length near 100 when editing scraper code (per `scraper/pyproject.toml`).
- Keep long call arguments vertically aligned, as seen in `bbl_pipeline/cli.py`.

### Types And Data

- Use pandas/numpy primitives for dataframes and arrays; avoid hidden schema
  mutations during processing steps.
- When writing JSON artifacts, convert numpy types to native Python types
  (see `convert_types` in `bbl_pipeline/cli.py`).
- Prefer explicit column drops for target/non-feature columns before training.

### Naming

- Python modules and functions: `snake_case`.
- Classes: `PascalCase` (e.g., `XGBLogRegEnsemble`, `Trainer`).
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (see feature penalty constants in training code).
- CLI commands use kebab-case (Click) like `analyze-oof`, `generate-oof`.

### Logging And Errors

- Use `structlog.get_logger()` for structured logging in pipeline modules.
- Prefer `click.ClickException` or `click.BadParameter` in CLI handlers.
- For ingestion, use `ErrorHandler` from `bbl_pipeline.utils.errors` and capture
  context (file path, league).
- Log summary metrics at the end of long-running commands.

### Files And Artifacts

- Model artifacts expected after training:
  - `champion_model.joblib`
  - `oof_calibrators.pkl` or `isotonic_calibrator.pkl`
  - `oof_calibration_results.csv`
  - `OOF_CALIBRATION_REPORT.md`
- Feature stores live under `data/<league>_feature_store_vX`.

## Project-Specific Rules (From Copilot Instructions)

- Active models only: use `models/bbl_v12`, `models/sat_v1`, `models/ilt20_v5`.
- Ignore `models/archive/` unless explicitly asked.
- Keep `models/model_registry.json` updated when:
  - Regenerating feature stores
  - Retraining models
  - Adding/modifying feature store columns
- Prefer the `bbl-pipeline` CLI for standard tasks.
- Use absolute imports from `bbl_pipeline`.
- Wicket penalty applies only to future projected runs; death phase penalties
  are minimal (approx 0.90-1.00).
- BBL v12 uses `data/bbl_features_v4/` with empirically calibrated penalties.

## League Calibration Guidance

- Recommended approach is global model + league calibration.
- Use `bbl-pipeline calibrate-league` with temperature or Platt scaling.
- Do not use isotonic for league calibration (too steppy).

## Testing Guidance For Changes

- Data/feature changes: run `pytest tests/unit/test_ingestion.py` and
  `pytest tests/unit/test_resolution.py`.
- Monte Carlo changes: run `pytest tests/test_simulation.py -v` and
  `pytest tests/integration/test_simulation_integration.py -v`.
- Pipeline changes: run `pytest tests/integration/test_pipeline.py -v`.

## Working Notes

- Data folders can be large; avoid committing raw data.
- Keep JSON/YAML outputs stable and deterministic when possible.
- Favor numpy/pandas vectorized operations over Python loops.
- When adding new CLI commands, wire them through `bbl_pipeline/cli.py` and
  update docs in `README.md` or `docs/`.
